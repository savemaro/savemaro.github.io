Hello everyone,

As the original development team is currently focusing on the advancement of other projects, the related development progress of MARO has stalled. Starting this week, Howe and I will jointly form a new team to be responsible for the subsequent development of the MARO main chain and the development of related new applications.

The projects I have been responsible for include the main chain [gttc](https://github.com/ttceco/gttc), the contracts involved in the decentralized exchange [TDEx](https://github.com/TTCECO/tdex) , [Tigris](https://github.com/TTCECO/Tigris) involves contracts and blockchain browser background services, etc. Projects Howe has been responsible for include [ACN](https://github.com/TTCECO/acn_smart_contract), [web3j](https://github.com/TTCECO/web3j), [Ledger](https://github.com/TTCECO/ledger-app-ttc), and [OAK](https://github.com/TTCECO/OAK), etc.

In the coming week, we will publish a short-term plan on MARO's progress in the community to ensure that all community members can understand our working methods and schedule. Following that, we will initiate the first development iteration next week.

We welcome more developers from the community to actively participate in the MARO project, fostering a more decentralized ecosystem for MARO. Throughout this process, the Foundation will do its best to provide official support to developers.

If you have any questions or suggestions, please feel free to contact us.
